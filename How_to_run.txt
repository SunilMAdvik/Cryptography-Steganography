Steps

1. Run "Send_Encryption.m" ...
    - select Plain_text file 
      Data to be Hided "Hide_Data"(16-bytes)
    - Give P and Q values for RSA Encryption
    -  Encrypt Plain_Text into Chiper_Text
      using Hybrid (AES-128 bit Encryption & RSA)
     plain text is converted  into chiper text and save as "Chiper_text"
2. Run "Send_stegno_Embedded.m" ...
    - Select Any image (Cover_Image) 
    To hide the Chiper Text in Image , color and grayscale image can be select
   - Apply DWT level 2 
   - Hide the Secert (Chiper_Text) Data into Image
   - save Stego image "Embed_IMAge.tiff"
3. Run "Reciver_Stegno_Extraction.m"
    - Get The Stego_Image 
    - apply DWT Level 2 , Extract the Chiper_text which hided in image 
    - save file 
4. Run"Reciver_Decryption.m" code
    - Get the Extracted chiper_text file 
    -  Apply Hybrid Decryption (Inverse AES & RSA) To get Original text 
       from Chiper text
